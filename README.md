This repository is to store my github copilot instruction settings 

## How to use .github/copilot-instructions.md file

You have to put `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file in your workspace or repository. 
VS Code automatically includes the instructions from the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file in every chat request and applies them for generating code.

**Notice:** 
- Set the [`github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles`](vscode://settings/github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles) setting to `true` to instruct VS Code to use the custom instructions file.

- Describe your instructions by using natural language and in Markdown format.
